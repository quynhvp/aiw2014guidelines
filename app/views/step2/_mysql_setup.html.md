# **MySQL Setup**

It's quite simple to have MySQL on Windows, we will use XAMPP, a full-stack web development environment.

You can download XAMPP from: [XAMPP download page](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html "Xampp download page")

### Install XAMPP

There's a notice when installing XAMPP, please uncheck the following packages unless you're really using them:

*   Mercury
*   Tomcat
*   Filezilla Server

### Turn on MySQL

After the installation, open **XAMPP Control Panel** to start MySQL server

### Using phpMyAdmin

You can manage your MySQL Databases using phpMyAdmin via the url: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin
"phpMyAdmin link on localhost")

*** Remember to turn on Apache also ***
