# **Rails setup**

As you know, Ruby on Rails is cross-platform, meaning that you can run it on both Linux, Mac OS or Windows. Personally,
I prefer Linux/Unix-based environments such as Linux distros (Ubuntu, Linux Mint...) or Mac OS. However, there are two
reasons for writing this guideline assuming that you're using **Windows**:

*   There is a larger number of students who are using Windows (7, 8, 8.1, even 10 DP)
*   Installing Ruby on Rails in Mac OS and Linux are much easier, you can find many tutorials online, or ask me I can do
it for you

Now, let's start!

### Step 1 - Download RailsFTW

There are multiple installation packages for Rails, including famous ones such as: Bitnami, Ruby Installers... However,
