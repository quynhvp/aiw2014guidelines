# **GIT Setup**

At the very first step, before any programming-related setup, we need to setup our collaboration environment. There are
two main source control systems: **SVN** and **Git**. In this course, we are going to use **GIT**

### Download & Install Git

You can download Git (not GitHub) at: [http://git-scm.org](http://git-scm.org "Git download link")

After that, install it on your Windows system

### Using Git Bash or Command Prompt

After installing Git, you can either choose to:

*   Use Git Bash as terminal environment
*   Integrate git into Windows command prompt (cmd)

### Integrating Git to Command Prompt

Do the following steps in Windows (7,8) to add Git path into environment variable:

*   Open **Environment Variables** (if you don't know how to, please ask your friend)
*   In the **Environment Variables** window, add this path into the PATH variable: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin".
Some of you may change the installation path of Git, so make sure to edit this path to the correct one

After that, restart Command Prompt (close and open another window)

Open Command prompt, type "git", if you see anything different from "Command not found", then it is working properly.
