# Design your website

In this section, we are going to discuss some key points about designing the interface for your web application.

### Sample HTML

As mentioned in the class, there's an existing HTML template that you can take and modify to use for your final product.
The template is packed up in the ** html ** folder of the *** AIW Starter 2014 ***, which is available at:

        https://github.com/minhprg/aiw2014starter

You can either:

*   Take this HTML template and modify based on your own topic and content
*   Use your own HTML template

As you're having many other programming courses and projects in the same semester, I strongly recommend you to take the
time to think and make a wise choice.
